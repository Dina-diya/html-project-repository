	<h1>Are robotics and artificial intelligence the same thing ?</h1>
    <p>The first thing to be clarified is that robotics and artificial intelligence are by no means the same things. Actually the two fields are almost completely separate.       </p>
	<h3>What are the differences between robotics and AI ? </h3>
    <p>Robotics is a technology division that specializes in physical robots. Robots are programmable machines that can usually perform a series of actions autonomously, or semi-autonomously.   
	AI is an informatics branch.this includes designing computer programs that would require human intelligence to complete tasks.Most AI programs are not used to control robots.The AI algorithms are only part of the larger robotic system , which also includes sensors , actuators, and non-AI programming, even when AI is used to control robots.</p>
    <h3>What are Artificially Intelligent Robots ?</h3>
	<p>The bridge between robotics and AI is that of artificially intelligent robots. These are robots powered by programs running AI.The majority of the robots are not artificially smart. </p>
